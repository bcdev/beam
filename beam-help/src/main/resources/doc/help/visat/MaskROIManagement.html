<h2>The Mask Concept</h2>


<p>Masks are useful to mask out image pixels either solely for image display or for
    image analysis. In the latter case we refer to a mask in the role of a <i>region of interest</i> (ROI).
    Currently BEAM supports three basic types of mask differing in the way the mask is defined:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Masks defined by a <i><a href="#BandMath">band maths expression</a></i></li>
    <li>Masks defined by a simple <i><a href="#Range">sample value range</a></i></li>
    <li>Masks defined by <i><a href="#Geometry">geometry</a> such as lines and polygons</i></li>
</ol>

<p>
    In data modelling terms, a mask is a product node similar to a band or tie-point grid. It has a unique name and
    comprises a image (raster data) whose sample data type is Boolean. Each data product may comprise virtually any
    number of masks.
</p>

<p>
    Not only the mask definitions but also their use in conjunction with a raster data set such as a band or tie-point
    grid are part of the data model stored within the product. A product "remembers" for a certain band or tie-point
    grid
</p>
<ul>
    <li>which masks have been switched visible and</li>
    <li>which masks are in use as ROI.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    A number of product formats define a default mask set. E.g. the Envisat MERIS L1 and L2 product types define a mask
    for each of their quality flags.
</p>

        <td style="border-width:0">Masks are managed by the <b>Mask and ROI Manager</b> tool window.
            To bring up this tool window click the tool button in the <b>Tool Windows</b>> tool bar or select the
            corresponding menu item in <b>View / Tool Windows / Mask and ROI Manager</b>.

<p>
    The manager allows creating new masks, editing mask properties and delete existing masks. It also allows
    for creating new masks based on logical combinations of existing masks. Furthermore masks may be
    imported and exported. If an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">image view</a> is selected, the manager tool
    window can also be used to
    control the visibility and its role as a possible ROI for the currently displayed band. When the mask's ROI role
    is selected, it becomes available in the various raster data analysis tools, such as
    the <a href="StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a>, <a href="HistogramDialog.html">Histogram</a>,
    and <a href="DensityplotDialog.html">Density Plot</a> tool windows.
