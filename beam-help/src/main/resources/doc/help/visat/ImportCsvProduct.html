<h3>Import CSV Product</h3>

<p>
    The CSV product reader enables VISAT to import simple CSV files into the BEAM product model. See
    <a href="CsvFileRules.html">here</a> for a description of the expected data format.
</p>

<p>
    Note that the CSV Product Reader interprets each column as band. As of BEAM 4.10.3, there is no support yet for
    neither metadata nor flag codings.
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of reserved properties which may be set within the file:
    <ul>
        <li><b>separator</b>: When this property is set, e.g. using <code>#separator=;</code>, the specified separator
            is being used for parsing the file.</li>
    <li><b>sceneRasterWidth</b>: Per default, the product will have quadratic dimensions, e.g. if the CSV file contains
        144 data entries, the product will have width and height 12. If the CSV file contains no square number of data
        entries, the next higher square number is being used and the added pixels are filled with NaN values. If,
        however, the property is set, the product's width will be set to the property's value and the height will be
        computed accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
