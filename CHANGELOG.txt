 Changes from 4.9 to 4.10
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) New BEAM Features

o VISAT has been greatly enhanced by a number of efficient and user friendly tools supporting validation activities.
  A number of tools now allow for comparing satellite data with correlative data (e.g. in-situ data or other reference
  data) imported from external sources. The former statistics tool window has been split into multiple, dedicated tool
  windows each providing a number of new functions.
    (1) General enhancements
        - Generate (ROI) masks from plots: mark a value range in the plot area (histogram, scatter, profile plots)
          and create a mask comprising the pixels that fall into that value range.
          The mask is immediately displayed as an overlay in the satellite image view and can be used as a new region
          of interest for statistical analyses;
        - Zoom into plot areas using the mouse wheel;
        - Axes in plots, if applicable can now use a log10-scaling;
        - Inspect and export (copy to clipboard) plot data as tabulated data.
    (2) Profile plot enhancements
        - extract satellite data from a transect or track and display it, optionally averaged over an NxN pixel box,
          optionally filtered by a ROI mask, optionally together with correlative data;
        - synchronise pixel positions: click the transect graphs in the plot and display a cursor which is shown in
          both, the plot and also along the track figure shown in the satellite image view.
    (3) Correlative plot
        - extract satellite data at geographical points, optionally averaged over an NxN pixel box, optionally filtered
          by a ROI mask, and display against correlative data fields in a scatter plot;
        - display regression line and information;
        - display the 1:1 identity line.
    (4) Scatter plot
        - compare two raster datasets and display a density plot of pixel frequencies, optionally filtered by a
          ROI mask;
        - quickly invert density colors;
    (5) Histogram
        - generate histograms of raster data, optionally filtered by a ROI mask;
        - bin cells of the histogram can now be log10 scaled, thus turning a logarithmic into a normal distribution.
    (6) Statistics
        - generate common statistical variables, including commonly used percentile thresholds, histogram and
          percentile plots;
        - optionally compute statistics for one or multiple masks in one go.

o In order to import the correlative data for the new validation tools, support for multiple types of text-based point
  and vector data sources has been added: plain text, tab-separated CSV files, data extracts from MERMAID in-situ
  database, and SeaDAS 6.x ship-tracks can now be read and used as vector data within VISAT. All additional columns
  are kept and, if numerical, may serve as a variable used in the scatter or profile plots.

o Double-clicking the imported vector data in the product browser window displays it in a tabular view similar to
  double-clicking a band which will an image view.

o Imported point data can now be interpreted as a path or track and will be displayed accordingly in an image view.
  Additional numerical columns of such imported point data can be directly displayed in the profile plot.

o The VISAT navigation window can now synchronise multiple image views based on the changing geographical
  center coordinate of a currently moved image.

o The VISAT colour manipulation tool window has been enhanced by log10 scaled colour bars.

o Three new readers have been added which allow for
    (1) reading data products of the new VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument.
        This capability is provided by the SeaDAS Ocean Colour reader which has been developed by the NASA OBPG
        as part of SeaDAS 7 (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/forum/oceancolor/board_show.pl?bid=28).
    (2) reading plain text, CSV files into the BEAM product data model; thus, input from such
        files may be used for example with the BEAM Graph Processing Tool 'gpt' command-line.
        Also a corresponding writer is available for CSV.
    (3) reading ordinary RGB image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, ...). Products imported from images comprise the
        bands red, green, blue with associated wavelength and a grey band which is a linear combination of
        the three.

o The VISAT file import / export menus have been revised due to the meanwhile large number of various data formats
  BEAM is able to import from and export to.

o The following BEAM command-line tool enhancements (see 'gpt -h' on the command-line) have been added
  - The pixel extraction operator 'PixEx' now uses an extended wild-card syntax to recursively collect source
    products from a list of directories.
  - A new operator 'Merge' allows for copying raster data from other data products to a specified 'master' product.

o The BEAM Java core data model has been revised: vector data is now based on the OGC-standard for simple features.

 Changes from 4.6 to 4.7
_____________________________________________________________________________


1) New VISAT Features and Improvements

o VISAT now provides a Geometry Management allowing users to draw and
  manipulate geometries (vector data) or to import them from ESRI Shapefiles.
  Geometries are now an integral part of the BEAM data model.

o The VISAT Mask and ROI Management has been revised completely. Any number
  of raster data masks can be defined by band maths expressions, value ranges
  and existing geometries. Each mask can serve as a region of interest (ROI)
  for raster data analysis.

o The Statistics, Histogram, and Scatter Plot tool windows have been enhanced
  in order to support the new, named ROIs. The Statistics tool window can now
  operate on multiple ROIs.

o The Reprojection (formerly 'Map Projection'), Mosaicing and
  Orthorectification processors have been redesigned from scratch.
  Due to the great GeoTools library, BEAM now offers more than 100 predefined,
  map projections based on their EPSG codes. For user-defined map projections
  you can now select from 25 map projection transformations and more than
  100 geodetic datums. Since the new Reprojection, Mosaicing and
  Orthorectification processors are developed using the
  BEAM Graph Processing Framework (GPF), they now offer a powerful command-line
  and can be used in any GPF XML processing graph for, e.g., pre- and
  post-processing. Finally, the runtime performance of this tools has been
  drastically improved.

o The Navigation tool window has been improved. It is now feasible to display
  a synchronized pixel cursor in all image views.

o The World Map tool window has been completely revised. It now uses a
  higher-resolution RGB (NASA Blue Marble) in which you can easily pan and
  zoom in and out.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 4.5 to 4.6
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) New VISAT Features

o A couple of new layers have been added to VISAT. Layers are used to enhance
  the (image) views by displaying additional data sources. The new layers are:
  - Images of other bands or tie-point grids
  - Images loaded from JPG or PNG image files
  - Images downloaded from a Web Map Service (WMS)
  - ESRI shapefiles
  - NASA Blue Marble for Lat/lon projected views
  - Wind speed vectors for MERIS

o The layer manager tool window is now used to add, remove, change, select
  and organise the layers displayed in the selected view.

o The new layer editor tool window is used to manipulate the properties of the
  selected layer.

o VISAT now allows to store and restore sessions. A session comprises all
  opened product files and associated views along with their layers and
  layer settings. A stored session only stores the file path references,
  not the product data.

2) VISAT Improvements

o The band arithmetic GUI has been completely revised and simplified.

o When creating non-virtual bands using band arithmetic in BEAM versions
  prior to 4.6, the raster data has been allocated in memory which often caused
  out-of-memory errors for large images. This problem has been removed, raster
  data is now computed when requested.

o The image export has been improved. Users can now specify the image output
  resolution. The created image files will directly represent the content of the
  selected view comprising all displayed layers.

o The colour manipulation window now indicates rough statistics generated
  from a low-res version of the displayed image. Users can now compute accurate
  statistics on demand.
  Colour palette import will now either
  - try to keep colours assigned to sample values or
  - distribute evenely between sample min/max range.

o Band arithmetic now takes into account no-data values from all bands and
  tie-point grids referenced by the band-math expression (with no loss in
  runtime performance).

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 4.2 to 4.5
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) New BEAM Features and Improvements

1.1) VISAT Imaging

The aim of BEAM version 4.5 is to efficiently handle high resolution data
products in terms of number of pixels per image. This has been achieved by
totally rewriting the imaging code used of BEAM. BEAM now uses
tiled images and image pyramids for a number of imaging operations. The result
is a greatly improved image display performance and memory usage.

o VISAT can now rapidly display, pan and zoom Envisat MERIS FRS and ASAR WSM
  products with up to 50000 x 6000 pixels per image. Also users of LANDSAT
  and ALOS AVNIR and PRISM will pretty much appreciate this enhancement.

o VISAT image views now comprise a semi-transparent navigation control field
  (similar to the one of Google Earth) used to move, scale and also rotate
  the current viewport. The control field can be switched on/off in the user
  preferences dialog. Usage of scroll bars is now also optional.

o VISAT now also comprises a layer manager used to quickly show/hide layers such
  such as bitmask overlays and to modify their transparency on the fly.

o Due to the new imaging technology used, the VISAT colour manipulation tool
  and statistics computation now perform very fast.

1.2) GeoTIFF Reader and Writer

o The GeoTIFF writer has been redesigned in order better adhere to the GeoTIFF
  specification. GeoTIFF files written by BEAM now also contain BEAM related
  product metadata.

o A new GeoTIFF reader also recognises BEAM related product metadata.

6) Other BEAM Software Changes

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.4.1 to 3.5
_____________________________________________________________________________


1) New VISAT Features

    o Statistics-Dialog is now non-modal. This means the dialog stays open while
      a different band can be selected whose statistics are then displayed.
    o Added new command 'Attach/Detach Pixel Geo-Coding' in the 'Tools' menu.
      This feature allows to use latitudes and longitudes provides as bands as
      current geo-coding. The driver for this new feature was the support of
      the new MERIS FRG and FSG data products.
    o Added new command 'Apply Convolution Filter' in the 'Analysis' menu.
      Convolution filter can be used to generate filtered versions of a selected
      band or tie-point grid.
    o Added new command 'Create Elevation Band' in the 'Tools' menu. This
      feature adds a new elevation band to the current product. The altitudes
      are computed by looking up each pixel in a selected hi-res DEM (which is
      by default the GETASSE30 DEM).
    o The output parameters dialog of the map-projection dialog has been
      enhanced. The parameters 'Reference pixel X', 'Reference pixel Y' and
      'Orientation angle' have been added in order to support the
	  requirements given by ALOS/AVNIR-2 geo-codings.

2) Data Processor Enhancements

    o  Cloud Probability Processor:
       - The processor uses now 2 improved neural networks. One is applied
          over the ocean and the other over land.
       - The processor is now able to write the logging output to the
         directory of the output product.
    o  Radiance to Reflectance Processor
       The new BEAM Radiance Conversion Processor converts TOA radiances into
       reflectances. Currently, only MERIS Level 1b products are supported
    o  The Mosaic Processor supports processing of products with a pixel-based
       geo-coding.

3) New general BEAM Features and Improvements

    o BEAM now can read ALOS/AVNIR-2 Level-1 products.
      Currently only products in the CEOS format are supported.
    o The MODIS bow-tie effect has been removed. Artifacts caused by this effect
      will disappear after map-projecting MODIS products.
    o A basic reader for NetCDF files has been developed in order to support
      GHRSST-PP products, the standard MERIS Level-3 data products and
      the upcoming Level-3 products of the GlobCOLOUR project
      (www.globcolour.info). Basically, the netCDF reader can support any image-
      like netCDF file structure up to netCDf version
      3.5. The NetCDf Java library version currently is 2.2.12.
    o The new MERIS Level-1b FRG and FSG data formats are now supported in BEAM.
      These data products add high accurary geo-location information the the
      standard MERIS FR and FRS products. Currently MERIS FRG and FSG are not
      officially available but can be generated using the AMORGOS software which
      will be available soon from the Envisat Tools page at
      http://envisat.esa.int/services/tools_table.html.
    o Several new options are available for the "pconvert" tool:
        o The options -W, -H force a specified width or height for image output.
        o The option -n specifies the color that should be used for the no-data layer.
        o The otpion -c specifies the file path to a text file containing a
          color palette definition.
        o When using an RGB profile you can use red, green and blue, or r, g and b
          for setting the RGB expressions.
    o The "map_proj" tool now supports pixel-based geo-coding (for MERIS FSG)
    o The list of available map projections has been extended by
        - Stereographic
        - Stereographic, Universal Polar North
        - Stereographic, Universal Polar South

4) Fixes

#094 - The MODIS bow-tie effect is now removed when MODIS products are
       reprojected
#xxx - (L3) Width and height of output product was wrong by 1.
#674 - Processors tried to open every output product as Dimap.
#673 - The progress bar of the ProductGrabber was not always autoTab when
       processing repositories
#669 - Exporting a not yet saved subset led to duplicated SubsetInfo
       metadata entries or in the special HDF5 case to an exception
#663 - NullPointerException in 'Import Transect Data' fixed if shape out
       of scene bounds
#641 - MapProjection was equal to all projected products within a session
       when same transformation was used
#623 - (9) "Assign ROI to multiple bands" now works for non-autoTab bands
           as well
       (8) "Assign ROI to multiple products" now deselects pin usage if
           no pins available in target product
       (1) "Assign ROI to multiple products" now transfers ROI shapes
           in pixel coordinates if the target product is spatial compatible.
           This prevents from pixel shifts occurring during transformation
           of the shape from the source product's to the target product's
           coordinate system.
#58x - If processors are aborted by user request the message "The request
       has successfully been processed" came up.
#48x - If output product is empty, IllegalArgumentException occurred.
#49x - If processors are aborted by user request, *.data and *.dim were not
       deleted.
#685 - Map-projection parameters not in sync with ellipsoid of given datum
       from source product
#686 - Many UI label texts did not have a trailing colon.

5) Java API Changes

    o ProductFileChooser.clearProductSubsetDef() added to be able to
      clear it before exporting the product again
    o New Processor UI
      In package org.esa.beam.framework.processor.ui multiple classes
      were introduced. The class MultiPageProcessorUI creates an UI where
      multiple pages can be added. The classes IOParameterPage,
      PropertyFileParameterPage and ProcessingParameterPage give default
      implementations for use with the MultiPageProcessorUI. For creating
      your own UI page, derive from ProcessingParameterPage and overwrite
      addParameterToPanel().
    o RasterDataNode.getGeoCoding() and setGeoCoding() were introduced so
      that each band can have its own geo-coding.
    o Discouraged the use of Product.getGeoCoding()
    o New ResamplingFactory class
      Creates a concrete resampling method by a given name.
    o FXYSum
      - Introduced a factory method FXYSum.createFXYSum() for creating
        instances by a given order and a list of coefficients.
      - Introduced a copy method FXYSum.createCopy(FXYSum fxySum).
    o New AbstractGeoCoding introduced
    o New Scene and SceneFactory intruduced
    o New method Product.transferGeoCodingTo(..)
    o New method FXYSum.createCopy()

6) Other BEAM Software Changes

    The XML support libraries 'crimson.jar' and 'jaxp.jar' have been
    removed from the $BEAM_HOME$/lib folder and all classpaths since
    they are not required anymore. 'nc_core.jar' has been added for supporting
    the NetCDF data format.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.4 to 3.4.1
_____________________________________________________________________________

Version 3.4.1 is a pure service release which fixes some severe problems of
version 3.4. The bug fixes are:

1) Processors did not accept empty parameters within a request file when
   running in batch mode.

2) If the shape outline transparency was set to 0, the fill transparency was
   ignored.

3) When overwriting an existing band using the band arithmetic and referencing
   this band in the expression, an error dialog is shown.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.3 to 3.4
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) VISAT Improvements

   o  Import/export file chooser dialogs now remember their last position and
      size on the screen
   o  Reduced memory consumption during opening an image view. Now 30% less
      memory is needed for image display
   o  Now it is possible to reorder the bitmask definitions inside the
      bitmask overlay window
   o  The user can now create own RGB image profiles, it's also possible to
      delete profiles, except the default VISAT profiles.
      If there are multiple applicable RGB image profiles, the user is prompted
      to selected the desired profile.
   o  Spectral wavelength of a band can now be assigned to a band in the
      properties dialog. The spectrum view will update itself to changes of this
      properties. Also the spectral bandwidth has been made editable.

2) Data Processor Enhancements

   o  Level-3 Binning Processor:
      - It is now possible to process multiple bands with different algoritms at once.
      - Added flux-conserving resampling (provided by Thomas Lankester)
        in addition to binning resampling.
      - The tailoring of the geographical size of the output product can now be controled.
      - Fixed the handling of products crossing the 180� meridian.

   o  MERIS Level-1b Cloud Probability Processor has been added.

3) Data Format Enhancements

   o AVHRR/3 Level 1b Reader
     - Supports NOAA -15, -16, -17 and -18.
     - Reads data format version 2 and 3.
     - Reads the HRPT and LAC format.
     - Autodetecs and reads products with 8bit , 10bit and 16 bit and
       calibrates the data with the in the metadata supplied coefficients.
     - Reads matadata and flags.

   o BEAM now fully supports the MERIS IODD 7.3 format changes (reprocessing 3).
     The changes affect only the MERIS Level-2 product format, they are:
      - The quality flag AERO_BLUE has been renamed to OOADB
      - The quality flag DDV has been renamed to LARS_ON
      - An additional WHITE_SCATTERER flag has been introduced for water pixels
      - The band aero_opt_thick has been split into aero_opt_thick_443 (land) and  aero_opt_thick_885 (water).
        A new (virtual) band aero_opt_thick_550 combines the two for both land and water.
      - The description of the band toa_veg changed to "MGVI - MERIS global vegetation index",
        and of band boa_veg to "MTCI - MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index"

4) Fixes
   o Fixes in map-projection:
     - Invalid samples in a source band are now correctly transformed to no-data
       samples in the target product.
     - The pixel resampling now fully considers the "valid-pixel expression" and
       "no-data value" properties. (#538)
     - Bitmask overlay information is now preserved from source to target bands if possible
   o In the final step (map-projection) of in the L3 binning processor the output product
     was not correctly closed. This was especially an issue when the output format was HDF-5,
     in this case a corrupted file was created.
   o The HDF-5 product writer now exports geo-coding information in a dedicated
     attributes group "geo_coding".
   o FLH/MCI and SMAC processors now correctly assign the spectral band index
     to output bands so that the spectrum view can now also be used on their
     output products
   o Changed MERIS flag descriptions: "non-confidential" --> "uncertain"
   o SmacProcessor: Message 'Unsupported input product of type ''. SMAC processes AATSR and MERIS L1b products.'
     on new request won't appear anymore.
   o Removed examples classes from beam.jar
   o PConvert does not use ConsoleProgressMonitor anymore
   o GETASSE30Reader did not set the file location for the products it created
   o When renaming a pin, upper/lower case letters have been ignored (#456)
   o Fixed problems with discontinuity in tie-point grids containing longitude and azimuth angles.
     In some cases, e.g. pole closeness, longitude values have not been correctly interpolated
     when tie-points values "jumped" from -180� to 180�. MERIS azimuth tie-point grids have
     been corrected for the range 0� to 360�.
   o Fixed the handling of negative values in the ATSR reader.

5) API Changes
   o added ProductUtils.overlayBitmasks(RasterDataNode raster, BufferedImage overlayBIm): BufferedImage
   o added Product.moveBitmaskDef(BitmaskDef def, int destIndex)
   o added constructor Tokenizer(String source, boolean caseSensitive)
   o added constructor RGBImageProfile(String name, boolean deletable)
   o added RGBImageProfile.isDeletable() : boolean
   o added constructor TiePointGrid(String name, int gridWidth, int gridHeight,float offsetX, float offsetY,
                                    float subSamplingX, float subSamplingY, float[] tiePoints,int discontinuity)

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.2 to 3.3
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) New VISAT Features:

    o No-Data Overlay
      Bands of a data product now determine by two means whether or not a
      pixel at a certain position contains data:
      - a no-data value is set and/or
      - a valid-pixel expression is given.
      In any case such pixels are now excluded from range, histogram and
      other statistical computations.
      In order to visualise the invalid pixel positions a new
      'No-Data Overlay' has been introduced. Its appearance can be adjusted
      in the VISAT preferences dialog.

    o Property Editor
      VISAT has now an editor for the most important properties of a data
      product and its bands and tie point grids. The editor is invoked
      either via the context menu which appears by right-clicking an item in
      the product tree view or the main menu. Currently the following
      properties have been made editable: name, description, units,
      no-data value, valid-pixel expression and virtual band expression.

    o Usage of general Expressions
      All usages of bitmask expressions (solely boolean expressions comprising
      flag values and the operators AND, OR and NOT) have been replaced by
      general mathematic expressions. E.g. the valid pixel expression in a
      for a ROI definition could now be "l2flags.LAND && reflec_6 / PI > 0.2".
      This change applies also to the VISAT bitmask overlay definitions and
      all data processors using a bitmask to decide if a pixel is valid or not.

    o Switchable UI Look & Feel
      In the VISAT preferences dialog, the look and feel of the VISAT UI can
      now be changed in the VISAT preferences dialog.

    o Band Arithmetic Enhancements
      Some new functions and symbols are now available for math. expressions:
      log10(x), exp10(x), feq(x), fneq(x), nan(x), inf(x), floor(x), round(x),
      ceil(x), rint(x).
      A new constant is 'NaN' (evaluates to not-a-number) and the new symbols
      'X' and 'Y' represent the current pixel position in the raster data to be
      processed.

    o VISAT Command Line Arguments
      The VISAT executable can now take product files paths as arguments.
      If your desktop environment allows for, you can then associate the
      "*.N1" extension of Envisat MERIS/AATSR product files or the "*.dim"
      of BEAM-DIMAP files to VISAT.

   For a more information on the features please refer to the VISAT help.

2) Other BEAM Changes and Improvements

    o Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5.0_03 is now used by default, but
      source code compatibility with the JRE 1.4.2 is still provided

    o The 'mapproj' tool and the Mosaic processor now prerecord the region to
      be map-transformed and thus create a spatial subset before applying the
      actual map-projection. This solves many situations in which certain
      projections (especially automatic UTM) where not applicable.

    o The dataset descriptors (DSD) of the Envisat specific product header
      (SPH) is now converted to a metadata element of a data product.

    o Data products now contain a metadata element 'History' which lists all
      transformations performed with VISAT, e.g. subset creation and
      map-projection.

3) Public BEAM Java API Changes

   o Many usages of deprecated methods and classes have been replaced or
     removed. The deprecated ConsoleProgressMonitor, ImageMagnifier and
     ImagePanner classes have been removed from org.esa.beam.framework.ui.

   o Many methods new have been added to the Product and RasterDataNode class
     in order to force the use of general arithmetic expressions
     (com.bc.jexp.Term)

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.1 to 3.2
_____________________________________________________________________________

For a more detailed description of each new feature please refer to the
VISAT help.

1) New VISAT Features:

    o Orthorectification:
      VISAT now has a tool to orthorectify MERIS and AATSR bands. Since the
      orthorectification requires the altitude above a given geodetic position,
      users can choose between tie-point grid elevations or the DEM "GETASSE30"
      which is the default DEM in BEAM.

    o Digital Elevation Map Installation
      Because of its size, the BEAM installer will not automatically install
      the GETASSE30 DEM files. If a DEM is selected in VISAT, it is checked if it
      is installed. If not, the user is prompted to download and install the DEM
      files. VISAT can also automatically download and install the selected DEM.
      For more information on the DEM installation, please refer to the
      "readme.txt" or the VISAT help.

    o Resampling Methods:
      The map projection and orthorectification tools now offer three different
      resampling methods: Nearest Neighbour, Bi-linear Interpolation and Cubic
      Convolution.

    o Create Subset from View:
      A new entry in the context menu over an image view provides a new command
      which opens the product subset dialog with the currently autoTab region
      as predefined spatial subset.

    o Pin Tool Behaviour Change:
      If the pin tool is selected and you click into an image, the pin is created
      and displayed immediately, the pin properties dialog does not pop-up
      anymore. If the pin is the double-clicked, the diolog opens as before.

2) General BEAM Extensions:

    o Data product export to GeoTIFF:
      Data products can now be exported in the GeoTIFF file format. All
      measurement datasets are stored as 32-bit-floating-point geophysical
      values. This will enable the import of data products supported by
      BEAM into many GIS and geographic imaging tools.

    o Since required by orthorectification, BEAM is now able to handle
      digital elevation models (DEM) in a generic way. The new class
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.ElevationModelRegistry
      can be used to register new DEMs in BEAM.

    o GETASSE30 Tile Import:
      A product reader has also been developed in order to import
      the tile files of the GETASSE30 DEM.

    o Projection Tool "mapproj":
      The batch mode projection tool "mapproj" now also supports orthorectification
      the new pixel resampling methods. Refer to the BEAM help for usage.

    o Mosaic Processor Version 2.1:
      A new mosaic processor version now makes use of BEAM's orthorectification
      capabilities.

    o MERIS Full Resolution, Full Swath Products:
      Envisat MERIS products of type MER_FRS_1P are now also supported by BEAM.

    o Help System Access for VISAT Plug-Ins:
      Visat plug-Ins can now have their own help-sets
      (Method org.esa.beam.visat.VisatApp.addHelp)

3) Public BEAM Java API Changes:
   New Methods:
      org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.AbstractBand.getPointing
      org.esa.beam.visat.VisatApp.addHelp
      org.esa.beam.util.SystemUtils.getBeamExtensionDirs
      org.esa.beam.util.SystemUtils.getBeamAuxdataDir
      org.esa.beam.util.PlugInLoader.create
   New Classes & Interfaces:
      org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Pointing
      org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGridPointing
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.resamp.Resampling
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.Orthorectifier
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.ElevationModel
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.ElevationModelRegistry
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.ElevationModelDescriptor
      org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.dem.AbstractElevationModelDescriptor

4) Bug Fixes:

    iss #394: Introduced missing GeoTIFF support into "pconvert" tool
              (since BEAM build 3246)
    iss #395: Switched back to JRE 1.4.1_05, since 1.4.1_07 caused a VM crash with
              VISAT graticule overlays. The VM crash is a known issue at Sun and
              is fixed in Java 1.5. For detailes, please refer to
              http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6215242
              (fixed since BEAM build 3246)
    iss #397: Exceptions in Processor.initProcessor have not been handled by the UI so far
              (fixed since BEAM build 3246)
    iss #276: Added help menu for all processor frames. An about box is now automatically
              created from processor metadata. Help can also be added to processors when
              started in stand-alone mode (fixed since BEAM build 3246)
    iss #389: Fixed binning processor AME algorithm: values where incorrect for weights != 1.0
    iss #378: Fixed +/-180 deg. problem with azimuth angles for MERIS/AATSR

    iss #340: If a mosaic processing request was saved with an easting less than the default
              value, a reload of the processing request caused an exception
    iss #393: The HDF4/5 product reader is now using a logger instead of System.println
    iss #392: SystemUtils.getApplicationHomeDir() contained '%20' in paths containing spaces
    iss #295: Fixed problem with importing pin text files

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 3.0 to 3.1
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) VISAT Improvements

   o VISAT can now perform an on-line version check at start up and automatically
     inform the user if a new release is available on the server.

   o The pin labels can now be displayed in the image view. For this purpose, a
     pin now has an extra label property. Text appearence can be set in VISAT's
     preferences dialog. (issue #107)

   o ROI handling has been clarified, a new command "ROI to Shape" has been
     introduced as an opposite to "Shape to ROI". "ROI to Shape" can also
     subtract the shape from the ROI, whereas "Shape to ROI" can delete the
     source shape in one step.

   o It is now possible to show/hide an extra shape layer displayed in the image
     view.

   o The preview image in the product subset dialog is now created from the
     most suitable band in a product. E.g., for AATSR L1b products we now use
     an infrared channel so that night-time scenes can also be viewed.

   o The misleading textual description of the MERIS Level 2 confidence flags
     (PCD_X) have been changed. If a confidence flag is set, it means that the
     corresponding pixel value is uncertain.

2) Map-Projections in Batch Mode

   o Map-projections can now be performed in batch mode using the new command-line
     tool 'mapproj' to be found in the 'bin' folder in the BEAM installation
     folder. The processing request file can take the same output parameters as set
     in the corresponding dialog of the map projection tool. Please find more
     information about 'mapproj' in the BEAM documentation.

3) Mosaic Processor Improvements

   o Parts of the Mosaic Processor have been redesigned in order to reflect
     the requests of many users. The user interface is now much more intuitive
     and flexible.

   o Output bands are defined by input sources - a mathematical expression
     formed by arbitrary input bands.

   o Any number of "valid pixel conditions" determine which pixels are considered
     in the output product. A condition is comprises a name and a boolean
     expression. The number of matching pixels can be stored for each condition
     in the output product.

   o The list of input products can now also be displayed in the world map.
     (issue #13)

4) Geo-location Improvements

   o Geo-location has been improved in terms of the algorithms used to determine
     the pixel coordinate for a given geographical coordinate. This transformation
     is heavily uses in map projections and for transect and pin management.
     BEAM now uses exclusively polynomial approximations. In former versions an
     iterative approach has been used, when the root mean square error of the
     approximation was too high. This was always the case for full orbit scenes or
     scenes near the earth's poles. The disadvantage of the iterative approach was
     that it was unstabe under certain conditions, e.g. near the poles, and returned
     wrong pixel coordinates in such cases (issue #264).
     The new algorithm now subdivides such scenes into smaller subscenes. An
     appropriate pair of approximation polynomials x(lat,lon) and y(lat,lon) is
     then derived for each subscene. In VISAT, the view "Analysis/Geo-Coding
     Information" as been adopted to reflect the changes.
     For developers: The new algorithms are implemented in the class
     org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGeoCoding

  o  The map-projection now preserves "log-scaled" property of an input band, e.g.
     MERIS Level 2 "algal_1". (issue #009)

5) BEAM API Changes relevant for Java developers

    o IMPORTANT CHANGE: processors developed against beam.jar as of BEAM 3.0 can no longer be
      run under BEAM 3.1, although we still support the processor API as of BEAM 2.3. The
      reason is that the class org.esa.beam.framework.processor.Processor
      implemented an unhappy interface called ProcessProgressListener which we dont want to
      support anymore.
      WE ARE VERY SORRY TO INCONVINCE YOU WITH THIS CODE CHANGE!

    o Also many other methods in the BEAM API dealing with progress monitoring have been
      deprecated or even removed. Please take a look into the API doc of interface
      com.bc.progress.ProgressController which is now the preferred way to observe
      progress in long running tasks.

    o Implementation of org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGeoCoding changed
      and due to this, some of its methods have been deprecated.

    o The JAMA linear algebra package has been included into the BEAM API, the package
      name is simply 'Jama'. Also refer to http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/Jama/.

    o The class org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Band has a new property: solarFlux.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 2.3 to 3.0
_____________________________________________________________________________

1) VISAT Image Navigation & Display Enhancements
   o New Navigation Tool Window: This important tool window replaces the
     magnifier and panner mini-windows which where used in former versions to
     scroll and zoom images. Besides many useful features many users will
     appreciate the option to synchronize zooming and panning of multiple views
     of spatially compatible data products.
   o New Zoom- and Panner Tools: In addition to the navigation window, standard
     zooming and panning can also be done using the mouse.
   o New image scroll bars, Zoom all: All image views now have scroll bars.
     If both scroll bars are autoTab, a tiny "Zoom all" button is now available
     which scales the image to fit the entire window (limited by the minimal
     zoom factor).
   o Open multiple views per band: Multiple views of any any band can be displayed
     by using "View" -> "Open Image View" multiple times. Double clicking a band
     does not open multiple views. With multiple views it is possible to view an
     overview in one window and a zoomed detail in another window.
   o ROI definition Window, new "Zoom to": The ROI definition dialogue has got a
     new funtion "zoom to ROI" (magnifier icon) which causes the image view to be
     panned to the ROI.
   o Pin Manager Window, new "Zoom to": The Pin Manager dialogue has got a new
     funtion "zoom to ROI" (magnifier icon) which causes the image view to be
     panned to the selected Pin.
   o Redesign of image display: Overall imaging performance has significantly been
     improved and image/graphic display has completely been redesigned and now internally
     uses a multi-layer model. The VISAT preferences dialog reflects the layer architecture
     by providing a property page for each graphic layer.
   o New image interpolation methods: The interpolation method for the image display
     can be changed in the preferences: either nearest neighbour, bi-linear or bi-cubic.
     This effects the only the display of images when zoomed in or out.
   o Improved graticule overlay: The graticule overlay has been re-implemented to
     be more robust for large products (e.g. AATSR orbits) or those extending over
     the day-line. Several new options for the graticule have been added in the
     preferences dialogue.

2) Mosaic Processor
   o A new Level 3 processor has been added. The main intention of the Mosaic
     Processor is to provide an alternative sampling algorithm that is able to
     create Moir�-free images. Especially when the pixel size of the input product(s)
     and the bin size ofthe target L3 product are of the same order of magnitude,
     the Mosaic Processor yields good results.
   o The generated L3 products are well suited for the production of images (e.g. RGB
     compositions). To provide as much as possible flexibility, the Mosaic Processor
     allows the use of any number of bands for the L3 product, the creation of virtual
     bands, the definition of criteria that include and exclude pixels with certain
     properties by using expressions.
   o The Mosaic processor includes several operation modes. Some of these are not
     accessible through the graphical user interface but through the Processing
     Request File. Please refer to the on-line documentation for details (Section
     Processing Request Concept).

3) VISAT UI Improvements
   o The product info and pixel info tabs on the left of the VISAT main frame
     are now composed of floatable internal tool windows. You can now
     float the geo-location window and switch back to the product tab.
   o Former VISAT versions used a scrollable desktop pane which contained
     the metadata and image views. Now we used a tabbed desktop pane
     without scrollbars. The views have their own scrollbars instead.
   o The "window" menu now contains new usefull window arrangement/tiling
     methods

4) Other BEAM 3.0 Improvements and Changes
   o Image Export as GeoTIFF:
     The displayed image can be exported as GeoTiff (Tiff with geo-location).
     This function is available via "File" -> "Export ..." -> "Export displayed
     image" -> set "File Type" to GeoTiff, or on the right mouse button when
     the mouse is over an image view ("Export displayed image")
   o "Export Metadata" to clipboard and file:
     This is a new command which lets a user copy the content of a metadata
     view to the clipboard or a file. It is available either from the "File" ->
     "Export" or the right mouse button when over a meta data view.
   o "Export Transect Pixels" to clipboard and file:
     When a shape has been drawn the pixel values of all bands along a transect
     can be exported to a file or the clipboard using "File" -> "Export" or the
     right mouse button. The export is done in the same format as for
     "Export ROI pixels".
   o Spatial product subsets are now also applied to the associated tie-point
     grid datasets. In former versions, the tie point grid data has been left
     untouched, only pixel offsets have been adapted to reflect the spatial
     subset. Especially verly large product subsets will profite from this
     improvement.
   o Sequentially appearing progress monitors have been replaced by a
     single progress monitor showing progress on two simultaneously
     displayed progress bars.
   o The lower resolution limit of the Level 3 processor is lowered to
     1 m so that also high resolution satellite products can be processed.
     Additionally, the estimated size of the final Level 3 product is
     updated in the user interface to give feedback about the expected
     processing times and storage requirements.
   o The BEAM/DIMAP format Version 1.4.1 now supports sensing start/stop time
     of the first/last scan line in a scene raster.
   o BEAM 3.0 uses the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.4.2 again. The bottle
     necks concerning imaging performance using 1.4.2 have been removed.
   o VISAT's tiny panner and magnifier windows which appeared in an image view
     have been dismissed in favour of the new Navigation Window
   o The layer properties from VISAT's preferences dialog are now assigned to
     the current view only. The layer properties for a new view is obtained from
     the current VISAT preferences.

6) BEAM API changes
   o IMPORTANT: Make sure to recompile your BEAM programs and VISAT plug-ins a
     against the new 3.0 version of $BEAM_HOME$/lib/beam.jar:
     Many methods of the BEAM API have been deprecated and many
     API changes affect the org.esa.beam.visat.VisatApp interface due
     to the new user interface.
   o org.esa.framework.ui.ImageDisplay now inhertits from the new,
     and very common com.bc.swing.GraphicsPane. This component stores
     the scene defining graphical objects in separate layers, namely the
     com.bc.layer.LayerModel. A separate view model allows to define
     the currently autoTab area of the scene. The layer model is
     com.bc.layer.LayerModel.
   o BEAM now uses the new framework com.bc.progress to allow for
     observation of nested processes. All other progress listener
     interfaces used formerly are now deprecated.
   o The org.esa.beam.beam.framework.util.SystemUtils now returns a correctly
     formatted path to the BEAM home directory also on Linux/Unix operating
     systems.

7) Bugfixes
   o ENVISAT ASAR geo-location accuracy has significantly been improved.
   o ENVISAT ASAR products often contain optional datasets. Such datasets are
     described by a DSD within a product but have no associated ADS or MDS.
     BEAM raised an IndexOutOfBoundsException when such products were opened.
   o A deleted shape is really deleted now and not shown again. A ROI created
     from a shape is not influenced by the shape's deletion.
   o A scaling error in the contrast stretch dialog occasionally raised
     exceptions when displaying histograms with extreme peeks.
   o When processing high resolution products with the Level 3 processor, the
     processor sometimes hangs. This behaviour is fixed. Also, the memory usage
     is significantly lowered.
   o In the SMAC processor, it was possible to set invalid values for the
     horizontal visibility leading to unpredictable behaviour. The validity
     range is now bound.
   o If a write-protected BEAM/DIMAP product has been opened and modified with
     VISAT, a consecutive save caused VISAT to hang. The 'save' command now
     prompts a warning dialog which tells the user, that the opened product is
     write protected and can not be saved unless the user removes the write
     protection. Otherwise the 'saveAs' command must be used.
   o A bug in the BEAM logging facilities is fixed that caused the creation
     of a ghost directory on any usage of the BEAM JavaAPI. When using the
     beam.jar in your own programs a "log" directory was automatically and
     unintentionally created by BEAM in the users home directory (Linux/Unix
     only).
_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 2.2 to 2.3
_____________________________________________________________________________

BEAM Extensions

1) MERIS Product Reader Extensions
   o Added support for the new MERIS RR/FR Level 2 product format. Backward
     compatibility with older formats is ensured. The new product changes are
     a) the band "aero_epsilon" has been replaced by "aero_alpha".
     b) new flags and corresponding bitmask definitions have been added:
         BLUE_AERO  - Aerosol with high Angstrom Exponent selected for atmosphere correction
         BPAC_ON    - Bright Pixels Atm. Correction activated (water)
         LOW_SUN    - Sun low above horizon (or conversely high Sun zenith angle)
     c) The DDV flag is now exclusively evaluated above land (LAND=true)
   o MERIS Level 2 products now have new composed quality bitmasks: For
     all bands of a Level 2 product an explicite "invalid" bitmask has been added.
   o MERIS Level 2 bands are now automatically displayed with important bitmasks
     overlays initially autoTab.
   o The unit of the MERIS Level 2 Photosynthetically Active Radiation (photosyn_rad)
     has changed from myEinstein / (m^2) to myEinstein / (m^2 * s)
   o The ENVISAT Product Reader API for C and IDL has also been updated to version
     2.0.4 in order to reflect the latest format changes.

2) Optimized Support for Large Files / Low Memory
   o VISAT now can perform some more operations on product data without actually loading
     data from a product file into memory and keeping it there. This allows for working with
     large product files even if the computer is low in memory. The operations are:
     a) Statistics, Histogram, Scatter Plot, Profile Plot, and Transect Coordinate List.
     b) Opening single band and RGB images
   o In order to control loading of raster data for image creation we have added a new
     option in the behaviour page of the preferences dialog. It's label is
     "On image open, load raster data only if size is below" and the value is the number
     of megabytes a raster can have so that it is completely loaded into memory. If you
     set this value to zero, VISAT will never load and store raster data in memory for image
     creation.

3) Map Projection Extensions
   o Two new types of map projections are now supported: "Lambert Conformal Conic" and
     general "Transverse Mercator".
   o The projection tool has been extended by the dialog "Projection Parameters" in order
     to parameterise the new projection types.

4) VISAT ROI Extensions
   o The "File/Export" menu now contains a new command "Export ROI Pixels" which
     can be used to export the values of all pixels contained in a ROI either to
     the clipboard or a text file.
   o The "Analysis" menu now contains a new command "Compute ROI Area" which
     can be used to compute the ROI area in sqare kilometers.
   o The ROI Definition Window now contains a new command "Assign ROI to other products"
     which is used to transfer the ROI to other open products. ROI shapes are
     automatically transformed into the satellite coordinate spaces of the target
     products.

5) Other 2.3 changes
   o BEAM 2.3 now uses the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.4.1 again.
     For some reason the JRE 1.4.2, which was used by BEAM 2.2, shows poorer
     imaging performance, especially if multiple images have been opened in VISAT.
   o The "File/Export/Export Displayed Image" command now can either export the
     entire image (as before) or just the currently autoTab clipping. Furthermore
     all overlays e.g. graticule, pins, bitmasks, ROIs are exported too.
   o VISAT's contrast stretch / color palette tool is now supported by a couple
     of predefined color palettes. They are stored in
     <BEAM-install-dir>/auxdata/color_palettes. The import/export file choosers
     in the contrast stretch / color palette dialog now use this folder by default.
   o A new setting in the VISAT preferences dialog now controls VISAT's
     "product-compatibility-check".
     This check is performed by the band arithmetic tool in order to decide which
     bands from which products can be used as data source in a band arithmetic
     expression. The setting label is "Consider products as compatible, if geo-locations
     differs less than" and can be found in the product setting page in the
     preferences dialog.
   o The pixel info view now also displays map coordinates in map units if a projection
     has been applied to the product. If applicable, map coordinates are now also considered
     by the "Copy pixel info to clipboard" command.
   o While performing the "Open RGB image" command VISAT now asks uses to select RGB
     bands if it cannot find a suitable predefined RGB profile.
   o For ENVISAT products, the properties tab in the statistics dialog now displays
     the actual sensing start and stop time for the product.
   o All processors now store the last directory the user has visited using the file
     selection boxes of the processor user interfaces.
   o In the main menu, the "Data" item has been renamed to "Analysis"

The important BEAM fixes are:

1) Map projections and graticule display now behave correctly if a product's scene boundary
   overlaps the 180 degree meridian. Older VISAT versions computed a wrong geographic
   extension in such cases.
   For developers: bug has been fixed in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGeoCoding
2) Date/time values are now displayed correctly in metadata views. There has been
   an error of up to 10 minutes before. The bug applies to the display only, actual date/time
   data was correct.
   For developers: bug has been fixed in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.ProductData.UTC.getAsDate
3) BEAM plug-ins have not always been found in the extensions directory.
   VISAT displayed an error message in its log file in this case.
   Under Windows, this happened when the path to the extensions directory contained
   one or more blanks. Under UNIX, sometimes a wrong path has been assembled.
   For developers: bug has been fixed in org.esa.beam.util.SystemUtils.getBeamExtensionDirectory
4) The product map projection module computed inaccurate pixel positions for a given
   geographical position, due to a mathematical rounding error in the projection algorithm.
   For developers: Math.round was used instead of the correct of Math.floor method to identify
   the correct pixel index in the source product. Refer to implementation of method
   org.esa.beam.framework.dataio.ProductProjectionBuilder.readBandRasterData
5) An ArrayIndexOutOfBounds occurred when using the bitmask reading method
   with a boolean buffer not exactly matching the requested width and height to be read.
   This also happened when the buffer was bigger than the requested data size.
   For developers: bug has been fixed in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Product.readBitmask
6) Several display problems fixed in dialog "Analysis/Histogram" and "Analysis/Scatterplot".
7) The dialog "Analysis/Transect Profile Data" displayed inaccurate pixel positions (x=12.5 y=4.5)
   became (x=13 y=5). This has been fixed.
8) A ROI definition including a value range also included pixels into a ROI which where masked invalid
   by default. This affected only bands with a default "valid-mask" set, such as all MERIS L2 bands.
   For developers: bug has been fixed in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.RasterDataNode.createROIImage
9) In the contrast stretch / color palette window the outer sliders of the color palette often could
   not be moved properly.
10) MODIS products can now be opened even if the file name does not meet MODIS naming conventions
    and even if external geolocation information is missing
11) Fixed several misconducts of user interface of the BEAM processing tools, e.g. wrong progress
    display. When invoked from VISAT, processing tools now do not overwrite products already opened
    in VISAT anymore.
12) VISAT now correctly (yes!) prints debugging information into the log file if selected in the
    preferences dialog.


BEAM Java API changes:

1) The org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf package has been partly redesigned in order
   to support generic user interfaces for map transformation parameters.

2) The class org.esa.beam.Product now supports the properties "sceneRasterStartTime"
   and "sceneRasterStopTime" which returns the actual sensing start and stop date/time
   for the data raster.

3) The org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.DataNode.setDataElems method now creates an
   internal ProductData object if none has been previously assigned to the DataNode instance.

4) The org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGeoCoding has a new public method
   "getNonAproximatePixelPos" which returns the exact pixel position for a given
   lat/lon value. However, this method performs several times slower than "getPixelPos".

5) Methods in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.RasterDataNode with names of the form
   "compute<X>" required to have the complete raster data loaded into memory. This is now
   no longer required, instead these methods reload data as needed. Therefore they also
   throw java.io.IOExceptions now in order to signal I/O errors.

6) Many other methods in org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.RasterDataNode now throw a
   java.io.IOException, which was either internally suppressed before or not required because
   they expected raster data to be loaded completely.

7) class BandArithmetic has been deprecated. Use
   org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.AbstractBand.computeBand instead.

8) The VISAT API (org.esa.beam.visat.VisatApp) has been extended by many more getter
   methods in order to better support VISAT plug-in developers. The new getter methods are:
        public VisatPlugInManager getPlugInManager();
        public Tool getActiveTool();
        public VisatPreferencesDialog getPreferencesDialog();
        public JTabbedPane getBrowserPane();
        public JScrollableDesktopPane getDesktopPane();
        public StatusBar getStatusBar();
        public JToolBar getMainToolBar();
        public File getUserHomeDir();
        public File getPreferencesFile();
        public Logger getLogger();

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 2.1.1 to 2.2
_____________________________________________________________________________

New BEAM 2.2 Features

1) New MODIS Product Reader
   o A subset of available MODIS products can now be imported in the BEAM
     software. The reader supports Terra and Aqua platform Level 1b and
     Level 2 Ocean products.
   o The majority of VISAT functions will also work for imported MODIS
     products, however the MODIS Bow-Tie Effect is left uncorrected, thus
     there are some restrictions with VISAT functions depending on
     an available product geo-location.
   o For detailed information please refer to the BEAM documentation.

2) New Map-Projection Features
   o A co-location feature has been introduced in the map-projection.
     It is now very easy to co-locate two products of same or different
     type (e.g. MERIS and AATSR, MERIS L1b and MERIS L2) so that they have
     identical geo-references and this can be used together, e.g. in the band
     arithmetic tool.
   o A new out-of-bounds value has been introduced in the map-projection
     output-parameters dialog. This value is used for output pixels which
     have no corresponding pixel in the source product.

3) New Image Contrast Stretch / Color Palette Features
   o A "Multiple Apply" function has been introduced in VISAT's contrast stretch
     window. It assigns the current constrast stretch / color palette settings
     to the autoTab bands of other open products.
   o It is now possible to import and export the color palette settings in VISAT's
     constrast stretch window.
   o A new auto costrast stretch function sets the autoTab min/max values to
     the full min/max range (auto 100%) of the underlying band.

4) New Color-Legend Export Function
   o A menu item "Export Color Legend" has been included in the context menu of
     image views. It is used to export the current color palette to an image file.
   o Multiple legend properties can be set in order to customize appearance of the
     exported legend image.
   o The legend preview can be copied into the system clipboard by using the
     centext menu item "Copy image to clipboard" in the preview dialog.

5) New ROI Definition Features
   o A "Multiple Apply" function has been introduced in VISAT's ROI definition
     window. It assigns the current ROI definition to other autoTab bands
     of the selected data product.
   o The ROI definition can now also consider the pixels located under the
     pins defined in the selected product.

6) Other new VISAT Features
   o The "Copy data to clipboard" function has now been implemented for all tabs
     of the statistics dialog. Herewith it is now possible to paste also the
     histogram and scatter plot data into e.g. Microsoft(R) Excel in order to
     create printable diagrams.
   o The expression editor of the band arithmetic tool now has a history function.
     VISAT automatically stores the last 100 expressions. Therefore it is now very
     easy to reuse complicated expressions entered older in VISAT sessions.
   o It is now possible to import/export multiple bitmask definitions at the same
     time in VISAT's bitmask overlay window.

7) Other VISAT Behaviour Changes/Improvements
   o Out-of-memory exceptions are now handled by a messages dialog which gives the
     user a tip how to solve the problem. For example, for large image files the
     image export tool often wrote a zero-byte image file without notifying the user.
     This happened because insufficient memory was available during the export.
   o On "Save as" a format conversion warning pops-up if the product which is to
     be saved is not a BEAM-DIMAP product. The warning says that a format conversion
     will take place which might take a while.
   o It is now possible no disable the inital visiblity of the magnifier whithin
     newly created image views. The default behaviour can be changed in VISAT's
     preferences dialog.
   o All product import file choosers now have predefined file filters. For example,
     for ENVISAT products the filter pattern is either (*.N1,*.prd) or all files (*.*)
   o The "Import Shape" command has been renamed into "Import Transect Data"
     and the default file extension is now ".txt". This has been done because some
     users thought they could import ESRI/ArcGIS Shape Files into VISAT which is
     not the case (at this time).
  o  A diligent compatibility check is now performed before new bitmask definitions
     are imported.

8) For Java Developers: A new example map-projection plug-in has been added. See
   src.zip$/org/esa/beam/examples/maptransf/ExampleProjectionPlugIn.java

Bug Fixes

 1) If product subsets have been imported, the underlying physical file was
    not accessible in the file system as long VISAT was running.
 2) Spatial subsets of map-projected files had wrong northing/easting values:
    they were just copies of the source map information). New northing/easting is
    now correctly calculated.
 3) User defined output scene size in the map-projection tool are now handled
    correctly.
 4) VISAT now fully releases virtual memory allocated by the graphic contexts
    of an image view. VISAT now also fully releases virtual memory allocated
    by closed products.
 5) Under UNIX operating systems, the BEAM extensions directory is now
    correctly identified. VISAT scans its extensions directory at start up time
    in order to load additional BEAM plug-ins.
 6) Double question dialog asking the user "Do you really want to close"
    has been reduced to a single one :-)
 7) In the contrast stretch window, the display of the histogram bins was incorrect
    for high vertical zoom levels.
 8) Histogram height settings of VISAT's contrast stretch window are now correctly
    remembered in each image view
 9) In transect data files (former "shape files", see above), the "Pixel-X" and
    "Pixel-Y" columns are not mandatory anymore if "lon" and "lat" values
    are given.
10) HDF5 export: incorrected image display range has been fixed
11) ROI Shape outline now correctly included in ROI (rectangles & circles)
12) VISAT crashed when invalid plug-ins (missing class files, invalid package names)
    have been placed in the "extensions" folder.
13) Plug-ins of type org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf.MapTransformDescriptor
    are now also correctly recognized by BEAM.
14) The cursor of the pin tool had a incorrect hot-spot (base point) on MacOS X and
    UNIX platforms.
15) Printing from VISAT Help System caused VISAT to hang
16) Spectrum view ignored the products [1+n] which have been opened before(!)
    the spectrum view window was opened. This has been fixed.
17) VISAT's contrast stretch window accidentally resetted the color palette
    settings to default grey-scale if an image view other than the selected one was
    closed.
18) If the user zoomed very deep into the histogram og VISAT's contrast stretch window
    (so that less than about 40 histogram bins were autoTab), the bin rectangles have been
    painted on incorrect locations.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 2.1 to 2.1.1
_____________________________________________________________________________

Version 2.1.1 is a pure service release which fixes some severe problems of
version 2.1.0. The bug fixes are:

1) Opening BEAM-DIMAP products which have been saved with VISAT versions prior
   2.0 caused an internal error (NullPointerException). This problem occurred
   because the BEAM-DIMAP format slightly changed in order to support the
   new gamma values for RGM images.

2) The "Copy pixel info to clipboard" function was out of order for MERIS
   Level 2 and AATSR products.

3) All UNIX platforms: The scripts which are used to run the BEAM
   tools from the command-line have not been executable. This problem
   was caused by an error in the script generation during installation.

4) If a DIMAP product has been opened in VISAT, the application hangs while
   saving the modified product on exit.
   (Question dialog "Save modified product?" --> Yes).

Also some general improvements concerning VISAT behavior have been introduced:

1) When dragged, the image magnifier does not center itself at mouse cursor anymore

2) Image display information of bands such as contrast stretch ranges and color
   palette points are now copied into the corresponding bands of the output products
   of the "Map Projection", "Data Flip", "New Product (Subset)" functions.

3) The "UTM Automatic" projection has been added to the list of possible
   UTM projections. It automatically selects a suitable UTM zone
   based on the product's center coordinate.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 2.0 to 2.1
_____________________________________________________________________________


New BEAM 2.1 Features

1) BEAM now runs on Mac OS X!

2) VISAT has some more RGB image enhancements accessible from the contrast stretch window:
   a) A gamma value can be entered for each RGB component in order to adapt the transfer function
   which quantizes (geophysical) source sample values to image sample values. For MERIS
   L1b, a gamma value of 0.7 for the blue channel yields to more realistic results.
   b) It is sometimes desirable to transform an image so that it's histogram matches that of a
   specified functional form. It is now possible to apply an equalized or normalized
   histogram matching to RGB images which can drastically improve image quality.

3) For exact geo-location, it is possible to explicitely set the reference point
   within the area of a pixel which is used to derive geolocation for a given pixel.
   Internally pixel positions are handled with drastically increased accuracy.
   The reference point and the pixel display type can be set in VISAT's preferences
   dialog.

4) BEAM-DIMAP format update:
   Added gamma value image information for bands.
   Added a valid-mask term for bands. The valid-mask is a bitmask expression used to identify
   whether a pixel of a band is valid or not.
   Added missing scaling factor and offset for a band to ENVI compatible header files.

5) The command line tool "pconvert" can now also apply histogram stretching to greyscale and
   RGB images. Please consult the usage page of pconvert (pconvert --help).

6) In the case of a processing failure, all processors now display a more detailed
   error report derived from the processor's log file.


Bug fixes

1) Some of the new (as of IODD 6) MERIS level flags have been mistakenly interchanged
   in the pixel info.
   The following flag pairs were affected: CASE2_ANOM and TOAVI_BRIGHT, CASE2_Y and TOAVI_BAD,
   ICE_HAZE and TOAVI_CSI, MEDIUM_GLINT and TOAVI_WS, HIGH_GLINT and TOAVI_INVAL_REC.

2) The Transverse_Mercator projection computed a slightly wrong y value (0% - 6% depending on
   the order of magnitude of the latitude).

3) If an RGB image was created from a map-projected product, VISAT showed a flickering
   progress bar which consumed a lot of processing power and caused VISAT to hang.

4) The Java source code examples (NDVI processors) now run correctly without any error messages.

5) "pconvert" now correctly creates RGB images again.

6) Geophysical bands of MERIS RRC products are now handled correctly.

7) VISAT fails to export very large images (e.g. full ASAR scenes) due to an internal
   out-of-memory error. To avaoid this behaviour the VM option Xmx should be used to
   assign more memory to VISAT as described in the FAQ on the BEAM web site.

8) The color sliders in VISAT's contrast stretch window will not fall over another again.

9) Changed physical unit of MERIS L2 total suspended matter to g/m^3, which has
   mistakenly been mg/m^3.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 1.1 to 2.0
_____________________________________________________________________________

New BEAM 2.0 Features:

1) MERIS Smile Correction Tool: A processor which performs a correction of the
   "smile effect" for MERIS L1b radiances.
2) VISAT Virtual Band Support: New bands can now be created based on an
   arbitrary mathematical band expressions.
3) VISAT RGB Image Support: The source of each of the three RGB channels can
   be any band in a product, even a virtual band. Constrast stretching is
   possible for each of the RGB channels also changing the source. Default
   RGB sources can be edited in the preferences dialog.
4) VISAT Pin Support: A pin is a marker for a certain geographical position.
   Pins can be set anywhere within the geographical boundary of a product.
   A pin manager window allows for pin selection, export and import. The spectrum
   window and the pixel info view can now be fixed to a selected pin.
5) VISAT World Map: A window which displays the geographical boundaries of all open
   products in world map image.
6) Support for ENVISAT Child Products has been added.
7) For high quality RGB output, "pconvert" tool can now also process mathematical
   band expressions as source for each RGB channel

Software Optimizations

1)  A product saved in BEAM-DIMAP format now require significantly less storage
    size.
2)  Reading from and writing to products in BEAM-DIMAP format is now around two
    times faster.
3)  ENVISAT products now requires significantly less heap space when opened in
    VISAT.
4)  VISAT image generation has been significantly accellerated.
5)  Images generated from ENVISAT tie point grids now display in half of the time.
6)  ENVISAT flag datasets can now also be displayed as images.

Bug Fixes

1) Provided support for ENVISAT child products
2) FLH processor band presets corrected from 7,8,9 to 6,7,8.
3) Band arithmetic produces a NullPointerException if bands
   whose data internally stored in integer arrays have been used
   within an expression.
4) In VISAT, Product "Properties" and "Geo Coding Information" can now be opened
   without the need to open an image view.
5) Missing help page for "Geo Coding Information" has been added.

Other Changes

1) When creating a product subset a history metadata element is now created in the new product
2) "save product history" option added to Data I/O page in VISAT preferences dialog
3) The VISAT plug-in directory "ext" has been renamed to "extensions"
4) Logging now makes use of the Java 1.4 java.util.logging API. Log files are now
    written to $BEAM-INSTAL-DIR$/log
5) BEAM-DIMAP Product Format Updates:
    - Version 1.1.0 added support for band attributes "scalingFactor", "scalingOffset" and "log10Scaled"
    - Version 1.1.1 added support for virtual bands
    - Version 1.1.2 added support for the "cyclic" attribute of tie point grids (i.e. longitude)
6) New VISAT resource bundle entry "popup menu text" added.
    "Place before" and "place after" are now fully supported.
7) The Java API has been improved and many classes/methods have been renamed.
   Major changes include
    - Library file name "matbx.jar" --> "beam.jar"
    - Package "matbx" --> "org.esa.beam"
    - Interface GeoCoding, method parameters: Point --> PixelPos
    - Class ProductData: get<Type>Elem --> getElem<Type>,
                         set<Type>Elem --> setElem<Type>
    - Class RasterDataNode: get<Type>Pixel --> getPixel<Type>,
                            set<Type>Pixel --> setPixel<Type>
    - Class Band (is a RasterDataNode):
       IMPORTANT: bands can now hold raster data as "counts" (e.g unsigned byte insted of float).
                  The actual geophysical value is computed by a linear or log-linear scaling. See
                  get/setScalingFactor, get/setScalingOffset, is/setLogScaled, isScalingApplied.
       IMPORTANT: getDataType now returns the data type of the band's "counts".
                  Use getGeophysicalDataType instead in order to determine the actual (or "natural")
                  type of the raster data samples.
    - Class BandDisplayInfo.BasicDisplayInfo --> ImageInfo
    - Class BandDisplayInfo.ROIDefinition --> ROIDefinition
    - Class BandDisplayInfo.BitmaskOverlayInfo --> BitmaskOverlayInfo
    - Class ROI --> ROIDefinitionVPI (the VISAT plug-in)
    - Class Processor: createUi --> createUI
                       getUiTitle --> getUITitle
                       log<X>  --> removed
                       process<X> --> fireProcess<X>
    - Class ImageFactory has been removed
      ImageFactory.create<X>Image() --> org.esa.beam.utils.ProductUtils.createRgbImage(Product p),
    - Class AbstractScientificToolPlugIn --> AbstractProcessorPlugIn
8) The ENVISAT Product Reader API for C and IDL (epr_c_api / epr_idl_api) have been removed from the main BEAM
   installer. They are provided as a separate download now.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
_____________________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT NOTE:

   The ENVISAT MERIS Level 1b product format has slightly changed. The
   'spectral shift index' has been replaced by a 'detector index' according
   to IODD 6.0 (PO-TN-MEL-GS-0003).
   The older format is still supported by all BEAM tools.

New Features

  1) New VISAT Spectrum Tool:
     Following many requests by users, we've added a spectrum tool to VISAT.
     The spectrum tool displayes the spectrum at a given pixel position.
     When the user moves the mouse over an image display, the spectrum display is
     immediately updated.
     The spectrum is read from the spectral bands of a product and
     works with ENVISAT MERIS L1b/L2 and AATSR L1b products.

  2) Optimized VISAT BEAM-DIMAP Storage:
     a) Once a product has been opened or saved as BEAM-DIMAP, VISAT now only
     writes modified bands to disk if the user saves the product again. The
     incremental save mode can be disabled in the preferences dialog.
     b) By default, ADS datasets from raw ENVISAT are not stored in the DIMAP
     XML header anymore. An option in the preferences dialog allows to change
     this behaviour.
     c) The in-memory representation of BEAM-DIMAP products requires
     significantly less heap space.

  3) Improved VISAT Map Projections:
     The output parameters in the map projection dialog now allow to specify
     the width and height in pixels of the output image. Hereby it is now
     possible to co-locate MERIS and AATSR products covering the same
     geographical regions.
     Formerly, width and height have automatically been selected in order to fit
     the complete scene in the output product. However, the auto-mode ist still
     available.

  4) Improved VISAT Pixel Info View:
     The pixel info view now can display the geo-physical values of all bands of a
     product, whether they are loaded or not. The preferences dialog allows to
     toggle the display of all or only the loaded bands.

  5) Improved FLH/MCI Processor:
     The FLH/MCI Processor now has an additional processing parameter. A
     cloud correction factor K now allows for reducing the effect of thin cloud.
     The formula we now use for FLH is:
         FLH = b8 - K * (b7 + (b9 - b7) * 16.262 / 43.786)
     where b7, b8 and b9 are the radiances or reflectances at 664.64, 680.902 and
     708.426 nm. The background is that (personal communication with Jim Gower:
        'If we use K=1, then FLH increases as radiance rises in thin cloud.
         We correct this using K=1.005.  This is what I mean by "reducing the effect
         of thin cloud."  We then find a mask at band 7 level 1 at about 50 radiance
         units gives a good picture. Using the same formula on level 2 reflectance
         data requires a mask at about .017 reflectance in band 7.')

Fixes

  1) VISAT now physically removes band data from the disk after a band has been
     removed.

  2) ENVISAT AATSR geo-coding & tie-point data have not been displayed correctly,
     because an across-track pixel shift was mis-interpreted.

  3) The FLH/MCI tool produced FLH values with an inverse sign.

  4) The binning tool continued processing with the next step although
     the user pressed the 'Cancel' button.

  5) The geo-location for ATSR products is now displayed correctly.

  6) Fixed a minor bug in tie point interpolation (affects only negative pixel indexes)

  7) Save (BEAM-DIMAP) product: A product description string is now available for ENVISAT
     products and stored in BEAM-DIMAP format.

  8) Command-line scripts: The UNIX bin/*-console.sh scripts contained a bad CLASSPATH:
     semicola have been used as path separators instead of the colon character.

  9) Image-export: After an image has been exported by VISAT, the image file was not closed
     and therefore unaccessible for other applications while VISAT was running.

 10) Debug-messages are now correctly written to the log file if this option has been
     enabled in the preferences dialog

 11) Open (BEAM-DIMAP) product:  Fixed a bug which occurred if XML attribute values in
     the DIMAP header contained special characters. They are now correctly encoded
     using XML entities (&amp; &lt; &gt; ...)

 12) Transect Co-ordinate List: pixel values are not rounded anymore

 13) Histogram, ScatterPlot, ProfilePlot: diagram labels are now rounded to
     a number of digits appropriate for the current value range.

____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 1.0 PR-3 to 1.0
_____________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: The overall project name changed. BEAM is now BEAM - Basic ENVISAT
Toolbox for (A)ATSR and MERIS.

VISAT Improvements and Changes

    1) VISAT Help has been completed.

    2) Bitmask definitions now also can have a description text which is
       stored in the BEAM-DIMAP header. The description is displayed as
       tool-tip text when the user moves the mouse over the list within the
       bitmask overlay window. VISAT now also uses reasonable descriptions
       for the default bitmask definitions.

    3) If a 'compatible bitmask' of another product has been used for a selected
       product, it now automatically becomes a bitmask of the selected product
       and as such it is stored in the BEAM-DIMAP header.

    4) Map projection changes:
         o  The Gauss-Kr�ger map projections have been taken away, since we
            currently only support the WGS-84 ellipsoid (and datum) and by
            definition, the Gauss-Kr�ger projection uses the Bessel ellipsoid.
         o  The UTM zones for the southern hemisphere have benn added.
         o  Map projection performance has been improved. Whenever possible,
            VISAT now uses a pair of polynomial approximation functions to
            retrieve a pixel's X and Y co-ordinates for a given lat,lon point
            as long as the product scene is in satellite co-ordinates (which
            is always the case for raw MERIS and ungridded AATSR data). The
            polynoms used can be inspected as ANSI-C code in the "Data" menu
            under "Geo-Coding Information..."

    5) VISAT's  "Open" and "Save as" file chooser dialog have been improved:
         o  The BEAM-DIMAP data directories do not appear anymore in the
            file list
         o  Both dialogs now also independently store the last directory the
            user visited.
         o  In both file chooser dialogs, the filename field was cleared if
            the user changed to another directory or the directory name
            appeared mistakenly. This behaviour has been supressed.

    6) The product "Close" command is now also available in context menus
       popped up over the open product's tree view.

    7) VISAT now warns the user on low memory conditions. The low memory
       limit in megabytes can be modified in VISAT's preferences dialog.

VISAT Bug Fixes

    1) When a band has been deleted, the tool commands map projection, band arithmetic
       and data flip threw a NullPointerException. Fixed.

    2) All UTM map projections had their center meridian in Greenwich (at
       zero degree) independently of their zone. Fixed.

    3) For tie-point grids, the histogram in the contrast stretch dialog was
       computed from the entire tie-point dataset although the product was
       a spatial subset of another product. Fixed.

    4) In ENVISAT metadata tables, the UTC start time display of a record was
       wrong. The time is now displayed correctly using the ISO-8601 format.

    5) Contrast stretching was sometimes impossible due to very narrow value
       ranges (e.g. reflectances above ocean, 1E-5 to 1E-6).

'pconv' Tool Improvements

    1) 'pconv' now is called 'pconvert' (yes, this is an improvement)

    2) An option (-r or --max-res) to limit output resolution in pixels has
       been added. Please refer to pconvert-readme.txt in your installation
       directory.

    3) 'pconv' can now also generate greyscale images from an arbitrary band.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 1.0 PR-2 to 1.0 PR-3
_____________________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL BETA-TESTERS:

     The BEAM-DIMAP format changed again! This time due to a spelling mistake.
     The tag name "Coordinate_Reference_System" was mistakenly spelled
     "Coordinate_Reference_Systsem". Older BEAM-DIMAP products will have no
     geo-coding information in this version, because the wrong, old tag
     name is not considered anymore. If you want to keep the geo-location
     information, open the BEAM-DIMAP header in a text or XML editor and
     rename all occurences of the old tag name.

Bug Fixes

  The migration to the J2SDK 1.4 caused some GUI problems with 1.3.1 based
  code.

  1) The code responsible for user-input validation did not function anymore
     with JDK 1.4 because of Swing's new underlying focus architecture. If a
     user entered an invalid number or text, the application got stuck due to
     an infinite focus-lost/focus-gained loop. This problem concerned VISAT
     and all BEAM processors.

  2) Popup-menus were sometimes hidden by the top-most window which was
     particularly very annoying in combination with the contrast stretch
     dialog.

  3) Map projections have not been saved correctly in the BEAM-DIMAP header,
     all projections have been mistakenly interpreted as 'Geographic Lat/Lon'
     projection. BEAM-DIMAP now writes and reads projections correctly.

  4) When using Windows UNC networkpaths, the BEAM-DIMAP XML header could not
     read and written, because of an I/O exception. The error message was
     'Connection refused'. This problem has been solved.

  5) BEAM-DIMAP now uses ISO-8859-1 character encoding instead of UTF-8.
     With UTF-8 it was not possible to re-open BEAM-DIMAP header containing
     special characters, such as german umlauts.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 1.0 PR to 1.0 PR-2
_____________________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL BETA-TESTERS:

  The BEAM-DIMAP format changed. It's true, products written with older Processor or
  VISAT versions can still be read, but meta-data string values will appear as
  comma-separated byte lists. The reason for this is that the old BEAM-DIMAP product
  writer module wrote meta-data string values as comma-separated byte lists to
  the BEAM-DIMAP XML-header by mistake. Of course, this drastically expanded the XML
  file size. In version 1.0, the writer module directly and correctly writes the
  string values as pure text.
  Note that you can directly edit the BEAM-DIMAP header:
     1. Open the concerning product's BEAM-DIMAP header (*.dim) in a text or XML editor.
     2. Then visit each occurence of MDATTR elements with the type="ascii" attribute.
        For example:  <MDATTR name="Algorithm" type="ascii">77,97,120,105, ... </MDATTR>
     3. Delete the complete element, or replace the byte list value, either by
        nothing or an appropriate value (if available)
        For example:  <MDATTR name="Algorithm" type="ascii">Unknown</MDATTR>

VISAT Changes

    1) The band arithmetic dialog has been improved:
        o user defined arithmetic exception handling
        o process monitoring

    2) The transverse mercator map transformation has been implemented.
       We have added some projections using this transformation. They are
        o Gauss Krueger Zone 2 to 5
        o UTM Zone 1 to 60

    3) It is now possible to create spatial subsets also from geo-referenced
       (map-projected) products.

    4) Dataset flipping is now also possible for data products without
       any attached geo-coding information.

    5) A new prefences setting has been introduced: auto-unload on/off

    6) The preferences dialog now contains two more graticule settings:
       the max. num of parallels and meridians.

    7) Although VISAT does not support direct editing of product nodes, such
       as bands, tie-point grids or meta-data, we included a 'delete' operation
       especially for bands in order to be able to remove bands that were
       mistankenly created by the band arithmetic tool.

    8) In the data menu, a new item 'Geo-Coding Information' has been
       added which provides the user with very detailed geo-coding information.

VISAT Bug Fixes

    1) In the product subset dialog a null pointer exception occcured
       when the dialog was closed before the thumbnail was completely loaded.

    2) Although a subset was selected, VISAT asked the user whether
       or not to build a subset, in cases where the total product size exceeded
       the (user-defined, see preferences dialog) maximum value.

    3) The BEAM-DIMAP product reader and writer have not considered a data product's
       description string.

    4) A thread synchronizing problem has been solved which occurred if a band was
       double clicked while another one was already being loaded.

    5) The HDF-5 export failed if a product contained empty meta-data attributes.
       Actually, this is a problem in the NCSA HDF-5 Java Library. A workaround has
       been provided: empty or null-value attributes are not written at all.

    6) The new bands computed by the band arithmetic tool showed a one-pixel
       (horizontal) shift to the right. Fixed.

    7) If the band arithmetic tool used
         o multiple input bands in an expression
         o and the bands originated from a map transformed product
         o and the band's pixels were processed on-the-fly (without being entirely loaded)
       then all band's pixel values seemed to have then same value. Fixed.

    8) When the graticule lat/lon resolution
         o was set to, for example 0.5 degree,
         o and then a global coverage binned product was displayed
         o and the graticule overlay turned on,
       then VISAT freezed due to pure Java 2D performance. The problem was fixed by the
       introduction of maximum parallel/meridian numbers.

    8) On exit, VISAT now asks the user whether or not new or modified products shall
       first be saved.

Java API Changes

    1) Added the boolean 'synthetic' property to the
       org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.DataNode class. For example,
       a org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Band created by the
       band arithmetic module is syntetic.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.8.4 to 1.0 PR
_____________________________________________________________________________

Important VISAT Changes

  1) New data manipulation features implemented
       o Band arithmetic
       o Map projection (only Geographic Lat/Lon so far)
       o Data Flip (horizontally, vertically & both)

  2) "New Product" command added

  3) New readers have been implemented for
       o ENVISAT ASAR IM*, AP* and WS* Level 1 data products
       o ERS 1/2 ATSR GBT and GSST data products


  4) IMPORTANT: Some ENVISAT band names have changed:
     In MERIS Level 1b Products
       o  "flags"         --> "l1_flags"
     In MERIS Level 2 Products
       o  "refectance_11" --> "refectance_12"
       o  "refectance_12" --> "refectance_13"
       o  "refectance_13" --> "refectance_14"
       o  "flags"         --> "l2_flags"

Bug Fixes

  1) For multiple record datasets, the VISAT metadata view always
     displayed the data of the last record of the dataset. This
     problem has been fixed.

  2) Throughout the Toolbox, an incorrect initialization of minimum
     floating point values might have led to incorrect results in
     statistics calculation and contrast stretching. This behaviour
     is corrected now.
     !!! All statistics calculated with older versions
     of the toolbox are potentially incorrect when the input data contained
     negative values !!!

Java API Changes

  1) The ENVISAT raw product file access class ProductFile now also supports
     the ASAR product types ...
     and the AATSR product types ATS_AR__2P und ATS_MET_2P.

  2) Many methods in ProductFile class don't throw I/O exceptions anymore which
     were caused by internal dataset descriptor database (DDDB) access and not
     directly related to the actual product file which was opened.

Minor Changes

  1) Multiple dialogs contain small buttons which open a
     special editor for a dialog parameter (e.g. bitmask-editor,
     file or color choosers). This button contains now the standard
     "..." text instead of a tiny icon.

  2) Optimization of product description string usages (reduced memory footprint).

  3) Removed all the spare fields from the metadata display

  4) After a subset in "Product Import" has been specified,
     now the "New Product" dialog opens asking the user to
     give the product a name and a description.


_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4
_____________________________________________________________________________


Bug Fixes

  1) If an image view had very few valid pixels, which means that most of the
     samples are zero, the contrast stretch pane often "swapped" it's sliders
     and that they where not movable anymore. This problem has been fixed.

  2) Two new MERIS Level 2 bands 'rect_refl_nir' and 'rect_refl_red' are
     now correctly loaded and displayed. They had mistakenly been interpreted
     as one 'rect_refl' band.

  3) The "illegal node name" error does not appear anymore when ENVISAT
     products are saved as BEAM-DIMAP products to disk and the filename contained
     unwanted characters.

General Improvements

  1) First version of the Binning Tool (Level 3 Processor) is now available.
     It consists of four independent processors:
     a) The "Binning Tool" which enables the user to process multiple input
        products in one run.
     b) The "Binning Initialize Tool" lets the user create a bin database with
        a given set of parameters (cell size, geophysical parameter to
        process ...).
     c) The "Binning Update Tool" lets the user accumulate multiple products
        to a bin database created with the "Binning Initialize Tool".
     d) The "Binning Final Tool" enables the user to process a final L3 Product
        from an existing bin database.

  2) New HDF5 output format for data products now available in the Java API, the
     data processors and in VISAT as export function.

  3) The new 'pconv' tool has been developed.

     'pconv' is a command line tool which lets a user convert BEAM-DIMAP, ENVISAT
     (and later also ERS/ATSR) into BEAM-DIMAP, HDF5 product formats.
     The tool can also generate RGB images in the following formats: TIFF, JPEG,
     PNG and BMP.
     The tool's executable name is 'pconv.bat' for MS Windows and 'pconv.sh' for
     unix operating systems and is located under '$INSTALL_DIR$/bin/'.

     Please look into the text file $INSTALL_DIR$/PCONV-USAGE.txt for the tool's
     usage. You can also call pconv with no arguments to get same help.

  4) Deinstaller is now accessible from the system's shortcut menu

  5) File chooser dialogues now don't loose their current filename anymore if
     the user changes into and out of a directory


New VISAT Functions and Improvements

  1) 'Import BEAM-DIMAP' Product' is now available in order to import product subsets
     in BEAM-DIMAP format. It can be used to import the possible huge output products
     of the level 3 binning tool.

  2) 'Export BEAM-DIMAP' Product' is now available in order to export product subsets
     in BEAM-DIMAP format.

  3) 'Export HDF5 Product' is now available in order to export products and product subsets
     in HDF5 format.

  4) ROI Import/Export functions have been fully implemented. They are accessible
     from the two corresponding tool buttons in the ROI definition window.

  5) Users are now asked whether or not they also want to add the available
     flag datasets to the current (spectral band) subset if they have forgotten
     to do so. The reason for that is, that VISAT can not display any bitmask
     overlays without the flag datasets.

Minor Changes

  1) The executables in '$INSTALL_DIR$/bin' have been renamed in order to provide
     more consistency.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3
_____________________________________________________________________________

This version is not only a bug-fix release since it also introduces new
functionality.


ENVISAT Reader Changes

 1) The ENVISAT reader module was modified so that it also supports so called
    L1b and L2 'child products'. Child products are currently the only products
    deliverd to beta-testers


New VISAT Functions

 1) Scatter-Plots have been introduced.
    Accessible from the 'Data' menu.

 2) Transect co-ordinate list and profile plot have been introduced.
    Accessible from the 'Data' menu.

 3) Geometric shapes (line, polyline, rectangle, ellipse and polygon)
    can be drawn on the image and directly assigned as ROI.

 4) The shape drawing capabilities are also available from the 'ROI Definition'
    window. It offers now three ciriteria to specify a ROI: geometric shape,
    value range, bitmask. The criteria can be AND/OR combined create the
    resulting, combined ROI.

 5) The current ROI overlay can now be exported to a standard image format.
    In the ROI overlay image, pixels not belonging to the ROI have a
    black color value (RGB=0,0,0), the pixels belonging to the ROI are
    diferent from zero.
    Usage: Export the exact set of pixels considered in a ROI and therefore
           the exact set od pixels contained within a shape, a value range
           and/or a bitmask.


 6) New function 'copy pixel-info to clipboard' is now available per right
    click (context menu) over images. All information available for a pixel is
    copied to the clipboard in text format so that it can be directly inserted
    in other applications (MS-Excel for example) using the paste function.
    A shortcut for the paste function is CONTROL-V key combination on Windows and
    LINUX or the 'Paste' key on Solaris.


VISAT Improvements

 1) The 'Activate ROI' option in the ROI definition dialog has been removed since
    it is superfluous. A ROI is at least specified by the three criteria. If none
    is selected, the ROI is now per se deactivated.

 2) The image magnifier now also shows the (magnified) graticule overlay
    and ROI shapes.

 3) More toolbar buttons have been added

 4) By default, VISAT logging is now disabled.


_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2
_____________________________________________________________________________

General Processor Improvements

 1) All processors now add the original processing request as metadata to
    the output product. The metadata includes
      o input product file path
      o output product file path
      o processing parameters

SST and FLH/MCI Processor Improvements

 1) The processors now copy the
       o original MERIS flags
       o the flag codings
       o the list of bitmask definitions
    from the input product into the output product.

VISAT Improvements

 1) If a BEAM-DIMAP product was inadvertedly selected instead of an ENVISAT raw
    file (in 'Import ENVISAT Product'), VISAT now tells the user to choose
    'Open' in the file menu.

 2) The complete set of MERIS L2 flags has been overtaken into the list
    of predefined bitmasks (applies to 'Import ENVISAT Product')

 3) The subset dialog now opens quicker for large products. The thumbnail image
    is now created in the background and displayed only if it is fully loaded.

VISAT Bug-Fixes

 1) In the bitmask overlay dialog 'new' and 'import' were disabled,
    although if a product has a flag dataset.

_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1
_____________________________________________________________________________

VISAT Improvements

1) VISAT now displays a "big product" warning, when huge files are opened.  VISAT now
  recommends a subset in this case. The preferences dialog provides an option to set
  this limit in megabytes.

2) The graticule's lat/lon texts often fall directly on a grid line. This has been improved.

VISAT Bug-Fixes

1) Bitmask compatibilty check was not performed correctly in bitmask overlay dialog
   if multiple different product types are open in VISAT. Fixed.

2) The wait cursor was missing while applying time consuming image changes with
   contrast stretch, bitmask overlay and ROI definition windows. Partly fixed.

3) When reloading bands from ENVISAT product, the progress bar does not show up
   anymore.

4) In the product subset dialog, the product size display is there, but was displaying
   "-1 M". Fixed.

5) Visat crashes with graticule layed over products with no geo-coding (tie points)
   attached.

6) Although a product had no flag coding or flags datasets, the bitmask criteria
   in the ROI definition window was enabled.

7) In the constrast stretch window, if the sample value was directly entered, the
   disabled apply-button did not get enabled. On Solaris, the context menu did
   not pop-up over the color palette.

8) If a subset was specified and a processor is invoked within VISAT on that product,
   the processor takes the full product on disk, not the subset.
   The workaround provided is that VISAT now displays a warning message telling the user
   to safe the file first.

Specific SST Processor Bug Fixes

1) SST does select an invalid coefficient file when opened for the first time
   and the coefficient set controls were not touched.

2) It is possible to select neither dual nor forward SST. One of them must at least be
   selected.

3) SST does select an invalid coefficient file when opened for the first time
   and the coefficient set controls were not touched.

   - ROI overlay properties

5) Open products view and pixelinfo view are now combined in a
   tabbed pane. The pixel info view will not hide dropdown menue entries
   anymore.

6) Metadata export to text file has been added.

7) lat/lon values are now displayed in DEG,MM,SS format

Changes in VISAT - Image Display

1) Graticule (geographic grid) overlay is now possible. Graticule properties are
   editable in VISAT's preferences dialog.

2) The magnifier window now displayes image borders correctly. A 1-pixel
   wide, white border is now drawn around each image, the background is set to
   black.

3) The magnifier window now draws a border around the current pixel so that
   the pixel position is autoTab also on images with poor contrast.

4) The magnifier now signals if it is out-of-image by displaying a warning string

5) Default mouse cursor changes to a crosshair cursor over image pixels



_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2
_____________________________________________________________________________

General changes

1) Standard dialogs doesn't have internationalized button texts anymore.
   All GUI components now use english text by default.


Changes in all Scientific Data Processors

1) The edit fields for input and output products now fill the available
   horizontal space.


Changes in the FLH/MCI Processor

1) A bug in the presets management (incorrect band name) was fixed.


Changes in the SST Processor

   removed the test coefficients.


Changes in VISAT

1) Visat writes a log file to the current working directory.


Changes in VISAT - Import subset dialog

1) As the tie-point datasets and most of the meta information contained in the
   original product loses the meaning when processing a subset of the product,
   tie-point  grids and meta information is not automatically imported to subset
   products anymore. The user has to switch this behaviour explicitely on.
2) When VISAT calculates the preview image, a wait cursor shows up to
   indicate that the application is busy.

Changes in VISAT - Contrast stretch

1) Fixed problems with integer/float conversions while zooming into the histogram.
   Handling of contrast stretch works smoother now.


_____________________________________________________________________________

 Changes from 0.7.0 to 0.7.1
_____________________________________________________________________________



Changes in all Scientific Data Processors

1) The physically unit and a description has been added to each band of the
   output product.

2) The default output product path for all procesors now correctly points to
   a (BEAM-DIMAP) file in the user's home directory with a processor specific
   default name.

3) All scientific processors can be invoked from within VISAT.
   The processed  output product can optionally be loaded directly into VISAT.



Changes in the SMAC Processor

1) Now creates it's available band list directly from the input product
   instead of holding product-type dependent, prefined band list



Changes in the FLH / MCI Processor

1) The value for invalid pixels is now editable.



Changes in the ENVISAT Reader

1) Sample values of MERIS L2 algal pigment index I and II, total suspended
   matter have been corrected; the exp(x) function has mistakenly been
   applied to the
   scaled geophysical variables instead of the pow(10,x) function

2) Sample values of MERIS L2 aerosol epsilon and optical thickness have
   been corrected; both used wrong entries for the offsets and scaling
   factors in the GADS

3) AATSR products can now be imported again



Changes in the BEAM-DIMAP reader

1) Supports a spectral band index for each band.

2) Now it is possible to store multiple BEAM-DIMAP products in a single directory.
   For each set of datafiles a corresponding subdirectory is created.



Changes in VISAT



Changes in VISAT - GENERAL

1) A context menu enables the user to load/unload a specific band.
   The band icon in the product browser changes it's appearance accordingly.

2) A "load flags" command is now available in the context menu.

3) A flag band cannot be displayed anymore and now has a special icon in the
   product browser.

4) Dialog titles and product nodes prefixing in UI has been made more
   consistent.

5) The status bar class has a new layout and provides a "memory spy" and the
   possibility to explicitely invoke the Java VM's garabge collector in order
   to free currently unused memory resources.

6) Commands for 'Show panner' and 'Show magnifier' in are provided in the
   'View' menu. These commands are enable only when a ProductSceneView is
   active.

   now attached to the currently active view.

2) It is now possible to have more than three color gradient sliders.

3) It is now possible to directly adjust the position of a slider by typing in
   a desired sample value.

4) The general appearance and handling of the dialog has been improved.

5) It is now possible to zoom into the histogram in order to accurately locate
   the sliders at a higher histogram magnification.



Changes in VISAT - PRODUCT METADATA VIEW

1) Flag values are shown as hexadecimal digits.

Changes in VISAT - BITMASK OVERLAY

1) An error in the expression editor occurring when closing the current product
   is fixed.

2) The bitmask properties of the selected band are now correctly displayed
   in the bitmask definition dialog. If the user changes the image view, the bitmask
   definition dialog displays the correct band-associated bitmask definition.

   BEAM-DIMAP reader.



Changes in VISAT - GCP EXPORT

1) Fixed wrong order of ground control points written (lat/lon instead of
   lon/lat as expected)

2) The number of GCPs written has been reduced to a value acceptable for ENVI.
   This property can be changed in the "Visat.preferences" file.
