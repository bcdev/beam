/**
 * Instances of <code>FeatureStatisticsWriter</code> enrich shapefiles or features with statistics.
 * <p/>
 * This is done like this:<br/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>the original shapefile is being opened and its features are loaded</li>
 * <li>a new feature type is created on the basis of the feature type of the original shapefile</li>
 * <li>this new feature type is being extended by the statistical means that have been computed</li>
 * <li>for each original feature, a new feature is created</li>
 * <li>the statistical values are added to each new feature</li>
 * <li>the new features are made availabe by the {@link #getFeatures()}-method</li>
 * <li>within the {@link #finaliseOutput()}-method, the resulting feature type and features are written to a new shapefile</li>
 * </ol>
 * Instances are created by using one of the factory methods this class provides.
