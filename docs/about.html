            </header>
            <p>BEAM is a platform facilitating a quick and easy development of great tools for the analysis and
                processing of Earth observation data.
                It comes with an extensible module framework and the intuitive VISAT graphical user interface. Several
                tools are included to employ
                the power of BEAM from the command line or within scripts.
                It's extensibility is well proven by diverse toolboxes and plugins, which have been built on top of
                BEAM. Some of the highlights are shown below. In addition, numerous BEAM extensions are available as
                plugins.

                    <p>The project SMOS Toolbox for BEAM (SMOS-Box) has been brought into life in order to support users
                        of data acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission.
                        BEAM and the SMOS-Box are user tools which ESA/ESRIN is providing free of charge to the Earth
                        Observation Community. The SMOS-Box software is developed by Brockmann Consult under ESA
                        contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated by Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

                    <p>SeaDAS is a comprehensive software package for the processing, display, analysis, and quality
                        control of ocean color data. While the primary focus of SeaDAS is ocean color data, it is
                        applicable to many satellite-based earth science data analyses. Originally developed to support
                        the SeaWiFS mission, it now supports most U.S. and international ocean color missions.
                        The latest version (SeaDAS 7.4) is the result of a collaboration with the developers of ESA's
                        BEAM software package. The core visualization package for SeaDAS 7 is based on the BEAM
                        framework, with extensions that provide the functionality provided by previous versions of
                        SeaDAS.

                    <p>The project CHRIS/Proba Toolbox for BEAM (CHRIS-Box) has been brought into life in order to
                        support users of data of the CHRIS sensor onboard of the ESA Proba platform. BEAM and the
                        CHRIS-Box are user tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth Observation
                        Community. The CHRIS-Box software provides extensions for BEAM, which allow accomplishing the
                        following tasks:<br>
                        Noise Reduction, Cloud Screening, Atmospheric Correction, Geometric Correction, TOA Reflectance
                        Computation, Feature Extraction

                    <p>The Next ESA SAR Toolbox (NEST) is used for visualising, analysing and post-processing the large
                        amount of data from ESA SAR missions, including heritage ERS-1 & 2, ENVISAT and future
                        Sentinel-1. In addition, the handling of data acquired by missions like JERS-1, ALOS PALSAR,
                        TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-1 & 2 and Cosmo-Skymed will be supported.<br>
                        NEST complements existing software packages and has been built on the BEAM Toolbox. It aims at
                        replacing the  Basic Envisat SAR Toolbox (BEST) and undergoes development with periodic
                        releases. An integrated data viewer and orthorectification and mosaicking of SAR images are new
                        functions, which were not provided by BEST.</p>

                        BEAM platform. The BEAM GlobToolbox 2.0 provides functions for the visualisation of various
                        large data products of the DUE "Glob"-series of projects, as well as for the generation,
                        inspection and analysis of time series generated from these global data products. </p>

                <span class="byline">History of BEAM</span>
            </header>
            <p>BEAM was initiated under ESA contract in 2001. The first non-preview version was released on the 6th
                of Decemeber 2002. Being the first ESA open-source project, BEAM has
                undergone more than 20 release cycles and has evolved from a basic ENVISAT/MERIS toolbox to an well
                accepted and mature platform for the analysis and processing of Earth observation data in general. Since
                initiation more than 30 projects have been realised by Brockmann Consult, either alone or as corporate
                partner, which have made use of BEAM and have essentially driven the BEAM evolution. Many third parties
                use BEAM internally.
                Nowadays BEAM has a vital and growing user community, and has become an institution for many users and
                developers dealing with the analysis and processing Earth observation data.<br>
                In 2014 the development of SNAP started. It was decided to join efforts and develop a common application
                for the upcoming Sentinel satellites. Brockmann Consult, Array and C-S France formed the consortium to
                create SNAP. Because of this effort the BEAM development has been concluded. But BEAM has a worthy
                successor in SNAP.
