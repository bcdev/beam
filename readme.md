# BEAM has been archived

Please note that BEAM is **not further developed**.
We encourage all BEAM users to use [SNAP](https://github.com/senbox-org) from now on. SNAP is the successor and evolution of BEAM. When installing SNAP along with the 
Sentinel-3 Toolbox you will have the same great user experience as with BEAM. You can even extend the number of features by installing 
other toolboxes like those for Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2. SNAP can be downloaded from the [STEP webpage](http://step.esa.int/main/).

The API stayed the same or has been kept similar as far as possible, so developers will feel at home too. 


BEAM software was a set of executable tools and an application
programming interface (API) facilitating the use
of the data products of a number of earth observation satellites.
BEAM has initially been developed to support the
data of the MERIS, AATSR and ASAR sensors onboard the ESA Envisat platform.
BEAM is developed under contract to [ESA/ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN)

Thanks to all our dear and loyal BEAM users. We hope that you now turn into SNAP users.
