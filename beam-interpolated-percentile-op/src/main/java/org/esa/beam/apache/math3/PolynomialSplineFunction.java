/**
 * Represents a polynomial spline function.
 * <p>
 * A <strong>polynomial spline function</strong> consists of a set of
 * <i>interpolating polynomials</i> and an ascending array of domain
 * <i>knot points</i>, determining the intervals over which the spline function
 * is defined by the constituent polynomials.  The polynomials are assumed to
 * have been computed to match the values of another function at the knot
 * points.  The value consistency constraints are not currently enforced by
 * <code>PolynomialSplineFunction</code> itself, but are assumed to hold among
 * the polynomials and knot points passed to the constructor.</p>
 * <p>
 * N.B.:  The polynomials in the <code>polynomials</code> property must be
 * centered on the knot points to compute the spline function values.
 * See below.</p>
 * <p>
 * The domain of the polynomial spline function is
 * <code>[smallest knot, largest knot]</code>.  Attempts to evaluate the
 * function at values outside of this range generate IllegalArgumentExceptions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The value of the polynomial spline function for an argument <code>x</code>
 * is computed as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The knot array is searched to find the segment to which <code>x</code>
 * belongs.  If <code>x</code> is less than the smallest knot point or greater
 * than the largest one, an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
 * is thrown.</li>
 * <li> Let <code>j</code> be the index of the largest knot point that is less
 * than or equal to <code>x</code>.  The value returned is <br>
 * <code>polynomials[j](x - knot[j])</code></li></ol></p>
