# The supported keys are:
#	description - a short description of the coefficient set
#	map.<x>     - definition of the coefficient map <x> as a
#                 range of zero-based, scanline column indices
#   <set>.<x>   - coefficient set corresponding to map.<x>
#                 where <set> is one of c (day) or d (night).
