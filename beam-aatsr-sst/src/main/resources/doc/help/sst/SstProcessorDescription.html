<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The SST processor can be invoked from the VISAT tool menu by selecting
    the <b>SST Processor</b> command. On the command line the SST processor is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM <code>bin</code>
    directory. Typing <code>gpt Aatsr.SST -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>SST Processor</b> command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:
</p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>(A)ATSR source product:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in VISAT:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
    the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SstParams.png"></p>

<h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate dual-view SST:</b> Here the processing of dual-view SST can be activated or deactivated.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Dual-view coefficient file:</b>
    Here one of the available coefficient sets for dual-view processing can be selected.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Dual-view mask:</b> Here a ROI-mask expression can be defined that will be evaluated
    during dual-view processing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate nadir-view SST:</b> Here the processing of nadir-view SST can be activated or deactivated.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Nadir-view coefficient file:</b>
    Here one of the available coefficient sets for nadir-view processing can be selected.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Nadir-view mask:</b> Here a ROI-mask expression can be defined that will be evaluated
    during nadir-view processing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Invalid SST value:</b>
    The value written to a target pixel when the pixel is excluded from the ROI or the SST calculation yields
    an invalid result.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The SST processing is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the SST
    processing is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<h5>Menu Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b>
    The entries found in this menu allow to save the current processing parameters to disk and to open a saved parameter
    set from disk.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Displays this help page.
